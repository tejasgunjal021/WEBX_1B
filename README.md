Problem Statement:

a.	Create a base class Student with properties like name, studentId, grade, and a method getDetails() to display student information.
Create a subclass GraduateStudent that extends Student with additional properties like thesisTopic and a method getThesisTopic().
‚óè	Override the getDetails() method in GraduateStudent to display specific information.
Create a non-subclass LibraryAccount (which does not inherit from Student) with properties like accountId, booksIssued, and a method getLibraryInfo().
Demonstrate composition over inheritance by associating a LibraryAccount object with a Student object instead of inheriting from Student.
Create instances of Student, GraduateStudent, and LibraryAccount, call their methods, and observe the behavior of inheritance versus independent class structures.

b.	Design an employee management system using TypeScript. Create an Employee interface with properties for name, id, and role, and a method getDetails() that returns employee details. Then, create two classes, Manager and Developer, that implement the Employee interface. The Manager class should include a department property and override the getDetails() method to include the department. The Developer class should include a programmingLanguages array property and override the getDetails() method to include the programming languages. Finally, demonstrate the solution by creating instances of both Manager and Developer classes and displaying their details using the getDetails() method.
